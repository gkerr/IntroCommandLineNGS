===Please describe an aspect of the course that you found particularly useful===
*Everything, it's just what I wanted
*The handout is excellent
*help of people around
*Getting understanding of linux
*I could learn basic of bash/shell programming and aquainting different software packages for NGS analysis was also useful.
*File formats; script is really useful! Best: running the programs
*Found out, that what I did until now was OK!
*Trying fastq, tophat, samtools on data -> very useful to demonstrate practically
*Introduction to NGS file formats and explanation of their differences
*Basic introduction to command line combined with some useful algorithms. Advanced course would be great
*Detailed explanation of all necessary commands. Very good handout!
*Step by step walkthrough RNAseq analysis. Very informative and well-designed handout
*Pipe and export. Handout
*everything was useful
*Being in a room away from my own computer and lab members so I could concentrate. (Under supervision!)


===Please describe an aspect of the course that you did not find useful===
*I know it is not easy, but would be nice to present things in a more interesting way... not easy to stay awake
*focus on eukaryotes
*Just nothing
*TIME! It was too slow in the intro, then too fast at the harder part!
*In general, everything was useful. However, I did some basic unix command line courses before, so I would prefer we spent less time on that and more on the actual NGS part.
*Too much time spent on file formats; go through that more quickly and spend more time on the commands, e.g. tophat etc.
*Interactive presentation about NGS-related data types. Too long and too little information which will stick. Short overview about most important ones w/i the script would probably be more useful
*The file formats part was a bit dry because we weren't using them yet.


===Additional Comments===
*Didn't like the presentations part, focusing on my task intensively really makes it hard to listen and understand other people's presentations
*Run the commans from one of the terminals to check if it works. :p
*Very useful, maybe need more time and information
*It was awesome course. Thanks a lot
*As I has a course before some infos were redundant - nevertheless it is good to repeat the basics as well. I would be really interested in doing more data analysis
*Really great course, you just need to spread it out over several days! But since you do it in your free time, some material benefit wouldn't hurt! :-)
*Printed summary of file formats after presentations would be nice
*All in all, very nice course! Looking forward to the more advanced one :) Thanks!
*A short introduction to the course organisers and what and where the work would have been nice. Thanks for put the course together!
*It would have been nice if you had introduced yourselves in the beginning =)

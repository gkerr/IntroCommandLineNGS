Overall Structure

•	File Navigation
•	File types for NGS
•	Getting help – reading manuals
•	Each section will include commands that do not work. These could be of the form: “The next command will not work. Why?” to “This will not work for one of 3 reasons, which are a) b) c) – which one is it” Make the command work.	

========

1.	File Navigation/Unix environment 

Example 1: Absolute Path (use samtools/samstat/fastqc as tool)
Example 2: relative Path (use samtools/samstat/fastqc as tool)
Example 3: Auto complete with tab (use samtools/samstat/fastqc as tool)
Example 3: File permissions (e.g. ls /bin ?? ls ~)
Example 4: Everything is a file
Example 5: which
Example 5: Environment variables and paths (getting and setting)
Example 6: echo

a.	Summary of section method? Quiz round?
b.	Extra info boxes
i.	Performing command on multiple files: find or for with e.g. ls  
ii.	In line execution statements (`) ?

2.	File Types

Fasta/fa/fai
Fastq
GFF
Rod
Sam/bam/bai
Ebwt
refSeq

Online databases – where to get this data e.gs:
Ensembl
UCSC
NCBI
Flybase


•	Example 1 – head
•	Example 2 – tail
•	Example 3 – less (?)
•	Example 4 – wc -l
•	Example 5 – grep -H
•	Example 6 – pipe ( e.g grep “chr1” myReferenceFile | wc –l )

a.	Participants will split into groups to research file types (google it). Will present a file type at random (pull from hat?). Could chance to ask questions and get discussion among participants
b.	Extra info boxes:
i.	ftp to get a lot of data at once
ii.	wget
iii.	tar
iv.	file corrupted end – anyway to fix it?
v.	sed (to get e.g. sample name/version number, from file name )

3.	Getting help – reading manuals

•	Example 1 – fastqc 
•	Example 2 – bowtie
•	Example 3  - samtools to sort files, view sections of files, 
•	Example 4  – GATK to get GC content, cut adapters, get coverage (? Bit advanced)

a.	Large emphasis on how to read manual/help pages
b.	What the command expects as input – required parameters and optional
c.	What will the output of the command be.



Round up:
•	Quiz style summary of day, where participants could create the questions/create an exercise.

===========

Notes:
1.	Commands should be given as images, so participants cannot copy and paste.
2.	Make sure they know that they should get support to install and set up computer. Emphasise they should get in contact with relevant people at their institutions.
3.	Point out that very useful tools are galaxy and taverna, which have a lot of unix commnds in graphical form and that you can build pipelines to share with others/importance of reproducible research (merging, concatenating, extracting columns from text files, search and replace)
4.	Can ask people to bring cake/luncheon material.Getting people involved HUB style ☺
5.	If weather permits could have bbq afterwards.

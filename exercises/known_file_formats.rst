File Formats
############

File Types to research and present:

* Fasta/fastq (sanger and illumina)/fai
* GFF/GTF
* Sam/Bam/Bai
* Vcf/bcf/Pileup/interval/ROD
* Bed/bigBed
* Wig/bigWig


Questions you could answer in your presentation (5 – 7 min)

* **What does each line in the file represent?**
* **What does each column represent?**
* **What character separates the columns? Can you write this character?**
* **Is there a file header?**
* **What online repositories are available to download this data and how can I download it?**
* What type of user/database/online tools uses this file format/who came up with it?
* Show an example of the file.
* What is the difference between the files you’ve been given?
* Can you convert between one file format and another?
* Any other information interesting information?


.. note:: Questions in bold should be asked about any file format you have been given.

NEXT STEPS
''''''''''

Look at the databases mentioned in the presentations and go through them in a live demo. Typical
will be Ensembl, UCSC, NCBI, GATK, 1000 genomes

SAM very important – re-enforce QUAL score, CIGAR string, FLAG
Quality scores – make reference to illumina vs sanger (Sanger pretty standard now)
